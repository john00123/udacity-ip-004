# Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Program
#### Programming Fundamentals
### Create a movie website
Code was written to store all the list of my favorite current movies, including box art and images hoster on **Wikipedia**. Additionally there is a link to the each movie's trailer that is hoster in **Youtube**. Code is used to generate a static web page allowing browsers to be able to read the information on a index.html file.

###### Website functionality
The website allows you to navigate through a grid base interface of box art imagery. Once a movie has been selected, there movie trailer will be shown to the user.

### Developer notes:
The project was built using python.
The movie variables has been created by using Classes.  ```media.py```.
Then the ```fresh_tomatoes.py``` file defines the html with styles to be created.

There are 3 files in this project:
